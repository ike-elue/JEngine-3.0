To Do

Status
    - Very Good :)

// Definitions for data
[0] = sender
[1] = dataType (optional, value of 0 is log data no matter what and 1 is the value of rendering data)
[2] = isRepeated (if 0, this sender sent it)
[3] = if repeated, this is what engine actually sent it
[n] = whatever you want...

- When posting things to console window, console window only changes based on timer or something like that

- Javadocs are done for:
    - None

0) Make every dispose return a string so there will be final message popup with all that was cleaned
1) Start rendering framework
    - <shader identifier, <type identifier (water, terrain, 3d model, shape, etc), <list of data arranged with those that are exactly the same right next to each other>>>\
    - For exactly the same, I mean:
	- same model
	- same type
	- same shader
	- mainly it can be a different transformation (pos, rot, scale)
2) Start adding functions for debug window
3) Start creating the basic gui 
4) If creating "Future" (Executor) objects constantly is slowing down the engine, 
come up with way to minimize it 
5) ... and so on since development should be a breeze



4 frames off for this approach assuming it takes one frame to update the engines

rendering engines can specify their own data to render, fbo stuff should be done outside 
rendering engine just to not waste time unless it is impossible
