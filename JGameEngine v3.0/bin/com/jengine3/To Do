To Do

[0] = sender
[1] = data type
[2] = say in console

1) Start Creation of the console
2) Create Console functions
3) Add debug Window
4) Test with pseudo engines
5) Add Framework
6) Test with pseudo engines
7) make sure every stage works perfectly
8) start coding the input engine
9) ... and so on since development should be a breeze

if an item is on top of another, it is dependent that frame

4 frames off for this approach assuming it takes one frame to update the engines

rendering engines can specify their own data to render, fbo stuff should be done outside 
rendering engine just to not waste time unless it is impossible
